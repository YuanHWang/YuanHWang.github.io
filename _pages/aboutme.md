I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Science, University of Arizona. My research focus is on large-scale snowpack modeling using deep learning and physics-based models. Another focus is to enhance physical-interpretability of AI systems applied to catchment-scale rainfall-runoff modeling.
