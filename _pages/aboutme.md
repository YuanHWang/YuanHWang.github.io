Hello! I'm Yuan-Heng Wang, a passionate hydrologist and data scientist dedicated to advancing the frontiers of hydrology and environmental science through cutting-edge machine learning and physics-informed modeling. Currently, I serve as a Water Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where my research focuses on large-scale rainfall-runoff modeling and understanding watershed responses to environmental disturbances.

I am also a designated campus collegae from my alma mater. I hold a Ph.D. in Hydrology from the University of Arizona, where I developed innovative approaches to bridge physical-conceptual and machine learning methodologies for hydrological systems modeling. I am a designated campus colleague from my alma mater. My academic journey also includes an M.S. in Hydraulic Engineering and a B.S. in Civil Engineering from National Taiwan University.

With a strong technical background in programming, high-performance computing, and geospatial tools, I have contributed to projects at institutions such as Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. My work has ranged from building data-driven reservoir operation models to integrating AI with snowpack and rainfall-runoff dynamics modeling. These experiences have culminated in peer-reviewed publications, invited talks, and collaborations with leading experts in the field.

Beyond my research, I am deeply invested in teaching and mentorship. I have taught courses in hydrology, weather, and climate and actively participated in outreach activities to promote open science and environmental awareness. I’ve had the privilege of co-organizing the HydroML Symposium and collaborating on initiatives to bridge AI and earth sciences.

When I’m not immersed in research, I enjoy exploring innovative ideas for interdisciplinary collaboration, reflecting on how science can drive sustainable solutions, and building connections within the global hydrology and environmental science communities.
